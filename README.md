## Graff's Gambit GG

It takes a lot of effort to make something out of nothing... and we really need help to put this programme together. Here's are some thoughts that have connected for me in the past and a renewed invitation for you to contribute.

### Codename "Graff's Gambit", GG

To make real the future we want to live in we need more founders — people who are able to generate, fund, and iterate on their ideas. We need people who are ready to validate and contribute to both emerging and established ideas.

We don't exactly know what challenges the next generation will face, we only know that they need to continue to be adaptable, to exercise critical thinking and empathy in the way that they overcome those challenges.

We offer them the resources we can spare, the most important of which is our attention. We listen, we validate, and iterate with them, modeling the behavior we want to propagate into the future.

To encourage the next generation of creative thinkers, those with the courage to speak their mind, the wisdom to listen to and understand others, and the discipline to show up.

"Graff's Gambit" is an educational programme designed to create the environment, place and time, where creative thinkers are encouraged to grow. The first of its iterations, the pilot programme, is designed specifically for the high school students at the Computer Science High-School "Grigore Moisil" Iași.

Through this pilot programme students get to learn through play, and develop the skills necessary to one day become founders of organizations that bring ideas to life, such as tech start-ups.

It is a simulation of the real world through the eyes of mentors who volunteer their attention and experience, who guide the experience of the students in a seemningly finite game of business, which teaches us about the infinte game of community.

The students play the role of founders. Their ideas evolve from inception, to validation, to implementation, with contant feedback from their peers and mentors.

The mentors play the role of financeers and advisors. Based on their experience, decision the founders make will be challenged appropriately to stimulate learning and adaptation.

### Proposed Structure

The programme runs in cycles and students are invited to participate multiple times. The game is highly replayable, and the ideas that didn't get funded in one round, will get another chance if they still have founders championing them in a future cycle.

Each cycle runs for 6 weeks, at 2 sessions per week, with the following milestones:

1. Opening Introductions — a short presentation of the programme, and the opportunity for students and mentors to introduce themselves

2. Forest of Ideas — a couple of sessions of iteration through ideas; students' ideas are heard, validated and understood; they learn how to ask each other constructive questions

3. Boostrapping — a couple of session for recruiting each other and initial effort funding; students learn how to ask for what they need

4. Cardboard MVP Factory — a few sessions of iteration on the ideas that got enough effort funding; students learn how to show up for the ideas that matter to them

5. Validation Station — a "market test guillotine", where ideas get virtual funding; students learn how to use resources they already have and listen to outside feedback

6. Expo Hall & Closing Ceremony — a short presentation of each of the ideas that got funding, an invitation to mingle, to learn more from each other, and an invitation to ponder which ideas (including those that didn't get funded) might be worth exploring next cycle

### What We Need

We're looking for mentors who can volunteer their time for a few hours every week across the programme. We will offer the training necessary to give the students the best experience in the programme, you just have to show up!

We're looking for funding for a full time Programme Manager role, as well as a few other support roles. These roles are currently filled by volunteers, and in order to make this programme sustainable for more than a pilot we're looking for generous donations.

We're looking for funding for specific events and materials supporting the programme. This programme will be successful if we can really offer students and volunteers and excellent experience. Any and all resources are welcome.

Finally, we're looking for guidance on all of this. We will continue to iterate on the idea and its implementation. We aim to practice what we preach. Pull requests are welcome.
